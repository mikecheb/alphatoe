# AlphaToe
A single page game of tic-tac-toe, with a snarky AI opponent.

Deliberately built with as few libraries as possible.

## Building
 * `npm install`
 * Make sure you have all the peer dependencies
 * `npm run build`

## Running locally
 * Serve the files in the `build/` directory. E.g., `cd build/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

## To-do list
- [ ] Show the user which row/column/diagonal is the winner
- [ ] Add a delay to make it seem like Alphy is thinking
- [ ] Track running scores
- [ ] Add local storage to save settings, score, state, etc.
- [ ] Add tests (especially for GosuPlayer)
- [ ] Add some sounds
- [ ] Bump some emoji around to make it pixel perfect
- [ ] Get a real designer to help with design
